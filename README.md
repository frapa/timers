# `timers` - Command line time tracking tool

`timers` is a simple and effective time tracking tool with a easy-to-use
command line interface. With `timers` you can:

- Log time on tasks

`timers` is written in rust and uses simple text files to save the tasks, which make it
extremely fast and lightweight.

## Install

On linux, just download the precompiled binary:

```bash
EXEC='/usr/local/bin/timers' && sudo wget https://github.com/frapa/timers/releases/latest/download/timers -O $EXEC && sudo chmod +x $EXEC
```

## How to use

### The basics 

To start logging time on a task, you use the `log` (or `start`) sub-command, like this:

```bash
$ timers log "Writing timers readme"
@1: Writing timers readme
status: logging
time: 0s
```

The `@1` is the task id, that you can use to reference the task later.

If you were already logging a task, `timers` will ask if you want to stop the current task and start the logging
on the new one.
 
You can check the current logging status with `timers status`, which will print a message with the currently
logged task and the amount of time you have logged on it.

You can stop logging on a task with `timers stop`:

```bash
$ timers stop
@1: Writing timers readme
status: stopped
time: 19m 41s
```

You can then resume logging on a previous task by id, as follows:

```bash
$ timers log @1
@1: Writing timers readme
status: logging
time: 19m 41s
```

### Introspection commands

If you want to see the list of all your tasks, you can run `timers tasks`

```bash
$ timers tasks
@1: My first task [stopped]
@2: Another task [logging]
```

You can get a the total time logged with the `report` command.
It works like this:

```bash
$ timers report days  # Or even simply `timers report`
Mon: 2h 16m 
Tue: 6h 34m 
Wed: 4h 10m 
Thu: 8h 37m 
Fri: 0s
Sat: 0s
Sun: 0s
```

### "Advanced" features

You can start logging at a certain time with:

```bash
$ timers log "Your task" --at 10:34
# You can also set the time to yesterday, by prepending y
$ timers log "Your task" --at y10:34  # yesterday at 10:34
# Or you can use relative time with + and -
$ timers log "Your task" --at -10  # 10 minutes ago
# For custom things, you can specify the full local date with time
$ timers log "Your task" --at "2019-11-10 11:10"
```

The nice thing is that if you're already logging, it will end
the current task at the specified past time point, so no overlapping
tasks will be logged!

## FAQ

**Why should I choose `timers` instead of any other time tracking tool**

3 reasons:

- You like simple things like plain text files. Who ever want a database instead of those?
- Let your colleagues think you're a genius who's always mysteriously typing into a black box.
- You believe global warming is a threat or you're laptop has a really shitty battery. 
- Colored terminal output. This alone would be enough do discard any competing tool.

**A command line tool? Come on, we're in the 2020s!**

Command line can be very simple and let me focus my energy on more important features.
Plus it's much more efficient (battery, memory, CPU) than any GUI tool,
or even worse web-based solution.

You're free to use your web-based tool that will eat 100 MB of your memory, download 10 Mb
of crap (including the very necessary 8 Mb of javascript code) just so you can click
the "log" button on a task.

**Where is my data stores? Are you stealing it?**

No way, it's all in the `.timers` folder inside your user folder (typically
`/home/<yourusername>/.timers` on unix systems and `C:\Users\<yourusername>\.timers`
on Windows).

**`timers` has a bug, what do I do?**

look into fixing it. Please provide a decent bug report.
